Link to Snake Code
https://copyassignment.com/snake-game-in-python-using-pygame/

I chose the Snake game in Python because it is a game I played a lot when I was younger.  So for nostalgia I decided on this. It is a code that runs a small game of snake that doesn't last very long but is effective.


What is an IDE? 
https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ide/
IDE stands for Intergrated Development Environment. It helps developers develop code more efficiently. It intergrates software, editing, building, testing and packaging capabilities all in one application. This will mean you can do it all in one instead of multipl applications that do each individually. This can allow for a more seamless and faster approach to coding. The key reasons why people will use IDE's are; the code editing automation. Coding has rules and an IDE knows those rules so can automatically edit the source code. Syntax highlighting will have the words in differing colours to differ between them. This also helps with identifying whether there are any errors. Intelligent coding can help you quickly finish a line by listing certain codes. 

What is OOP?

OOp is the acronym for Object-Oriented Programming. This will work well for large and complex programmes that are  actively being updated and maintained. OOP focuses on data or objects rather than functions and logic. It is good for collaboration based work and it also includes code reusability, scalability and effeciency.

What is pair programming? 
https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-pair-programming/
Pair programming is a software development technique where two programmes will work together. One of the will be in control of the keyboard, the driver, and the other will be in charge of the mouse, the navigator. The technique was made so two programmes can work and collaborate simultaneously. The driver is in charge of writing code, while the navigator will be in charge of looking for any errors or mistakes. It is also expected tht roles will routinely change so that both programmers are actively participating. This can be helper for beginners to coding, working alongside each other or even a more versed coder. They can learn by watching them and then switch to write the code, having someone check and help with any adjustments. This can also allow for more of a non-biased or wider area of coding knowledge to be shared and written.

What is Python?
Python is a computer programming software that is versatile enough that you can use it for web development, data science and automation. It was also used to create Netflix's recommendation algorythim.

What is a fixed mindset?
A fixed mindset is where you believe the intelligence and other qualites are unchangeable. That what you have/are will never change. The knowledge or skills you currently hold will remain the same.


Which parts of this course made you feel doubtful of your own innate ability?
Reading and explaining which parts of code mean. As I am still learning and not fully capable of understanding complicated codes, I find it hard to answer with complete certainty.

What are you looking forward to learning about programming?
I look forward to learning how to fix or change parts of codes so that I can make changes to codes at work without outside help.

Did you hear a self critical voice in your head throughout the process of learning during this last few weeks? What did it say to you? Do you believe what it said?
Yes I did and a lot of it was just me iterating to myself that I am not a developer, I am a designer and that you don't know this and you can't learn this because it isn't natural to you.

So far, what was the hardest moment of this course for you?
Finding a code that I liked and didn't seem to complicated for me to understand and then explain which parts of codes were meant to do.

If you could send a time traveling text message back to yourself at the start of this course, what would it say?
Don't be afraid to ask questions if that means you can find understanding in the answers. Your instructor is there to help and that includes answering questions to help with your confusion.
