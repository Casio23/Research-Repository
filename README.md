I chose the Snake game in Python because it is a game I played a lot when I was younger.  So for nostalgia I decided on this. 

What is an IDE? https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/ide/
IDE stands for Intergrated Development Environment. It helps developers develop code more efficiently. It intergrates software, editing, building, testing and packaging capabilities all in one application. This will mean you can do it all in one instead of multipl applications that do each individually. This can allow for a more seamless and faster approach to coding. The key reasons why people will use IDE's are; the code editing automation. Coding has rules and an IDE knows those rules so can automatically edit the source code. Syntax highlighting will have the words in differing colours to differ between them. This also helps with identifying whether there are any errors. Intelligent coding can help you quickly finish a line by listing certain codes. 

What is OOP? https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/object-oriented-programming-OOP
OOp is the acronym for Object-Oriented Programming. This will work well for large and complex programmes that are  actively being updated and maintained. OOP focuses on data or objects rather than functions and logic. It is good for collaboration based work and it also includes code reusability, scalability and effeciency.

What is pair programming? https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/what-is-pair-programming/
Pair programming is a software development technique where two programmes will work together. One of the will be in control of the keyboard, the driver, and the other will be in charge of the mouse, the navigator. The technique was made so two programmes can work and collaborate simultaneously. The driver is in charge of writing code, while the navigator will be in charge of looking for any errors or mistakes. It is also expected tht roles will routinely change so that both programmers are actively participating. This can be helper for beginners to coding, working alongside each other or even a more versed coder. They can learn by watching them and then switch to write the code, having someone check and help with any adjustments. This can also allow for more of a non-biased or wider area of coding knowledge to be shared and written.

What is Python?
Python is a computer programming software that is versatile enough that you can use it for web development, data science and automation. It was also used to create Netflix's recommendation algorythim.
